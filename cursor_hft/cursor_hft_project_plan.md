- ✅ ARM64-specific optimizations and HFT patterns
- ✅ Complex concurrency debugging and memory ordering
- ✅ Comprehensive test and benchmark generation
- ✅ **NEW:** Single-header template implementations

**❌ Confirmed Limitations:**
- ❌ Multi-file coordination and dependencies
- ❌ Complex template parameter consistency across files
- ❌ Over-engineered architecture on first attempt

### Proven Effective Prompting Strategies
**✅ Works Exceptionally Well:**
- **Single-header approach:** Eliminates coordination issues
- **Focused scope:** One component per prompt
- **Specific performance requirements:** Clear latency targets and memory constraints
- **Explicit constraints:** Power-of-2, trivially copyable, memory ordering specifications
- **HFTTimer integration:** Leverage proven working components

**❌ Avoid:**
- Large multi-component system requests
- Complex interdependent file generation
- Ambiguous architectural requirements

### Development Process Insights - VALIDATED
- ✅ **Git safety net essential** for experimental AI development
- ✅ **Documentation of prompts** crucial for understanding success patterns
- ✅ **Iterative complexity** significantly better than all-at-once architecture
- ✅ **AI debugging** can be as effective as manual for specific errors
- ✅ **Single-header strategy** unlocks Cursor's full potential for complex components
