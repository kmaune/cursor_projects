# HFT Trading System Project Plan & Status

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Build a high-frequency trading system for treasury markets using AI-powered development tools (Cursor, Aider, etc.) to compare against manual implementation.

**Target Performance:**
- Tick-to-trade: 5-15 microseconds
- Order book update: 200-500 nanoseconds
- Market data processing: 1-3 microseconds
- Zero memory allocation in hot paths

**Platform:** MacBook Pro M1 Pro (48GB RAM, macOS Sequoia 15.5)

## Architecture Decisions
- **Asset Class:** US Treasury markets (bonds/notes/bills)
- **Threading Model:** Start single-threaded, evolve to multi-threaded message-passing
- **Language Features:** Advanced C++ (templates, atomics, lock-free, custom allocators)
- **Market Data:** Synthetic treasury data generator + optional real data integration

    - System health monitoring

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS)
- **Progress:** 
  - âœ… Cursor environment configured with .cursorrules
  - âœ… High-performance timing framework generated and built successfully
  - âœ… Comprehensive test suite and benchmarks created
  - ðŸ”„ Testing timing framework performance and correctness
- **Next Steps:** Validate timing framework, then proceed to lock-free messaging system

## Key Technical Patterns to Implement
- **Memory Layout:** Cache-line alignment, NUMA awareness
- **Concurrency:** Lock-free algorithms, atomic operations, memory ordering
- **Performance:** Template metaprogramming, constexpr optimization, zero-cost abstractions
- **Architecture:** Event-driven design, message passing, deterministic execution

## Development Tools Strategy
- **Primary:** Cursor for main development
- **Secondary:** Aider with local models, other AI-enabled IDEs
- **Validation:** Compare against manual implementation
- **Goal:** Minimal manual coding, maximum AI assistance

## Outstanding Questions & Decisions
- Specific treasury instruments to focus on (2Y, 5Y, 10Y notes?)
- Real market data integration timeline
- Multi-threading migration strategy details
- Backtesting data requirements and sources

## Success Metrics
- **Performance:** Meet latency targets consistently
- **Code Quality:** HFT production standards (memory safety, determinism)
- **Learning:** Deep understanding of design tradeoffs and optimization techniques
- **AI Effectiveness:** Quality of AI-generated code vs manual implementation
