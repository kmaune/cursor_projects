# HFT Trading System Project Plan & Status

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Build a high-frequency trading system for treasury markets using AI-powered development tools (Cursor, Aider, etc.) to compare against manual implementation.

**Target Performance:**
- Tick-to-trade: 5-15 microseconds
- Order book update: 200-500 nanoseconds
- Market data processing: 1-3 microseconds
- Zero memory allocation in hot paths

**Platform:** MacBook Pro M1 Pro (48GB RAM, macOS Sequoia 15.5)

## Architecture Decisions
- **Asset Class:** US Treasury markets (bonds/notes/bills)
- **Threading Model:** Start single-threaded, evolve to multi-threaded message-passing

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS)
- **Progress:** 
  - ✅ Cursor environment configured with .cursorrules
  - ✅ High-performance timing framework completed and tested (PRODUCTION QUALITY)
  - ✅ All timing test cases passing with proper concurrency handling
  - ✅ Benchmark shows <100ns timing overhead (exceeds HFT targets)
  - ❌ First messaging system attempt failed (complex multi-file coordination issues)
  - 🔄 Preparing simplified messaging system approach
- **Current Task:** Clean slate messaging system with single-header approach
- **Next Steps:** 
  1. Clean up failed messaging code (preserve cursor_prompts documentation)
  2. Create simplified messaging prompt (SPSC ring buffer focus)
  3. Test Cursor's capabilities with simpler architecture

## Key Learnings: AI-Driven HFT Development

### Cursor Capabilities Assessment
**✅ Excellent Performance:**
- Single-component generation (timing framework = production quality)
- ARM64-specific optimizations and HFT patterns
- Complex concurrency debugging (fixed histogram issues)
- Comprehensive test and benchmark generation

**❌ Struggled With:**
- Multi-file coordination and dependencies
- Complex template parameter consistency across files
- Include path management in large systems
- Over-engineered architecture on first attempt

### Effective Prompting Strategies
**Works Well:**
- Specific performance requirements (latency targets, memory constraints)
- .cursorrules for project-wide context
- Focused single-component requests
- Clear error-specific debugging prompts

**Needs Improvement:**
- Large multi-component system requests
- Complex interdependent file generation
- Template-heavy architectures with cross-file dependencies

### Development Process Insights
- **Git safety net essential** for experimental AI development
- **Documentation of prompts** crucial for understanding success patterns
- **Iterative complexity** better than all-at-once architecture
- **AI debugging** can be as effective as manual for specific errors

## Development Tools Strategy
- **Primary:** Cursor for main development
  - **Best for:** Single-component generation, debugging specific issues
  - **Avoid:** Complex multi-file architectures on first attempt
- **Secondary:** Aider with local models, other AI-enabled IDEs
- **Validation:** Compare against manual implementation
- **Goal:** Minimal manual coding, maximum AI assistance
- **Documentation:** cursor_prompts/ directory tracks all AI interactions and lessons learned

## Outstanding Questions & Decisions
- Specific treasury instruments to focus on (2Y, 5Y, 10Y notes?)
- Real market data integration timeline
- Multi-threading migration strategy details
- Backtesting data requirements and sources

## Success Metrics
- **Performance:** Meet latency targets consistently ✅ (timing framework achieved)
- **Code Quality:** HFT production standards (memory safety, determinism) ✅ (timing framework)
- **Learning:** Deep understanding of design tradeoffs and optimization techniques ✅ (ongoing)
- **AI Effectiveness:** Quality of AI-generated code vs manual implementation
  - **Timing Framework:** Exceptional quality, rivals manual implementation
  - **Complex Systems:** Needs simplified approach and iteration
  - **Debugging:** Very effective for specific, targeted fixes
