# IMPLEMENTATION SESSION CONTEXT

## Code Generation Standards
- **Complete Files:** Generate full headers, implementations, tests, benchmarks
- **Build Integration:** MUST update CMakeLists.txt with new executables
- **Documentation Level:** Comprehensive inline documentation including:
  - Design decisions and rationale
  - Performance optimization explanations
  - Integration complexity details
  - Alternative approaches considered
  - HFT-specific optimizations

## Component Template Pattern
Every component must follow this structure:
```cpp
// 1. Cache-aligned data structures (64-byte ARM64)
// 2. Object pool integration for zero allocation
// 3. Ring buffer messaging compatibility
// 4. Template-based compile-time optimization
// 5. Treasury market data integration
```

## Performance Requirements (Component Level)
- **Latency targets** specified per component
- **Memory allocation:** Zero in hot paths
- **Cache behavior:** Optimize for L1 cache on ARM64
- **Branch prediction:** Optimize common code paths
- **Template specialization:** Use for performance-critical sections

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Auto-iterate:** Build failures, simple test failures, obvious integration issues
- **Escalate after 3-4 attempts:** Complex architectural problems, performance regressions
- **Always validate:** Builds successfully + all tests pass + benchmarks meet targets
