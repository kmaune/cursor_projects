# IMPLEMENTATION SESSION CONTEXT

## Code Generation Standards
- **Complete Files:** Generate full headers, implementations, tests, benchmarks
- **Build Integration:** MUST update CMakeLists.txt with new executables
- **Documentation Level:** Comprehensive inline documentation including:
  - Design decisions and rationale
  - Performance optimization explanations
  - Integration complexity details
  - Alternative approaches considered
  - HFT-specific optimizations

## Component Template Pattern
Every component must follow this structure:
```cpp
// 1. Cache-aligned data structures (64-byte ARM64)
// 2. Object pool integration for zero allocation
// 3. Ring buffer messaging compatibility
// 4. Template-based compile-time optimization
// 5. Treasury market data integration
```

## Performance Requirements (Component Level)
- **Latency targets** specified per component
- **Memory allocation:** Zero in hot paths
- **Cache behavior:** Optimize for L1 cache on ARM64
- **Branch prediction:** Optimize common code paths
- **Template specialization:** Use for performance-critical sections

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Auto-iterate:** Build failures, simple test failures, obvious integration issues
- **Escalate after 3-4 attempts:** Complex architectural problems, performance regressions
- **Always validate:** Builds successfully + all tests pass + benchmarks meet targets

## Integration Validation Checklist
- [ ] Integrates with object pools correctly
- [ ] Uses ring buffer messaging patterns
- [ ] Maintains cache alignment requirements
- [ ] Follows treasury market data conventions

## Test Requirements
1. **Functional Tests:** Core component behavior
2. **Performance Tests:** Latency and throughput validation
3. **Integration Tests:** Compatibility with existing infrastructure
4. **Edge Case Tests:** Error handling and boundary conditions

## Benchmark Requirements
- **Latency measurement** using established timing framework
- **Throughput validation** for data processing components
- **Memory allocation verification** (must be zero in hot paths)
