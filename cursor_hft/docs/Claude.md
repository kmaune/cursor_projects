# Architecture Decisions & References

## Design Philosophy
- **Performance First:** Optimize for latency consistency over average performance
- **Zero Allocation:** No memory allocation in critical trading paths
- **Mechanical Sympathy:** Understand hardware behavior and optimize accordingly
- **Deterministic Behavior:** Prefer predictable performance over peak optimization

## Component Architecture Patterns
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component has clear, focused purpose
- **Loose Coupling:** Components interact via well-defined interfaces
- **High Cohesion:** Related functionality grouped within components
- **Performance Isolation:** Component performance independent where possible

## Integration Architecture
- **Message Passing:** Ring buffer-based communication between components
- **Memory Management:** Object pool-based allocation for deterministic behavior
- **Timing Coordination:** Unified timing framework across all components
- **Data Consistency:** Treasury market data format standardization

## Future Evolution (Parallel Agent Development)
- **Strategy Interface Standardization:** Common interface for AI-generated strategies
- **Performance Isolation:** Strategies must not interfere with core infrastructure
- **Risk Management Integration:** All strategies subject to unified risk controls
- **Automated Validation:** Tournament-style testing and optimization
