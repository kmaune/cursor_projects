# Phase 2 Messaging System - Lessons Learned

## First Attempt Issues
- Complex multi-file coordination failed
- Template parameter mismatches across components  
- Include path inconsistencies
- Over-engineered architecture for initial iteration

## Key Insights
- Cursor excels at single-component generation (timing framework)
- Struggles with complex inter-file dependencies
- Better to start simple and iterate than build complex systems

## Next Approach
- Single header implementation
- SPSC ring buffer only (start simple)
- Direct timing integration
- Prove concept before adding complexity
