# HFT Trading System - AI-Driven Development

A high-frequency trading system for US Treasury markets built using AI-powered development tools (Cursor → Claude Code) to demonstrate AI-assisted financial system development.

## Project Goals

**Primary Objective**: Build a production-grade HFT system using AI tools and compare development effectiveness against manual implementation.

**Performance Targets**:
- Tick-to-trade latency: 5-15 microseconds
- Order book operations: 200-500 nanoseconds  
- Market data processing: 1-3 microseconds
- Zero memory allocation in hot paths

**Platform**: MacBook Pro M1 Pro (48GB RAM, macOS Sequoia 15.5)

## Current Status

### Phase 3: Trading Logic (IN PROGRESS) 🔄
**Infrastructure Complete, Strategy Validation Pending**

#### ✅ Verified Working Components
- **Order book**: Sub-microsecond operations (407ns add, 13ns best bid/offer)
- **Feed handler**: 1.98M msgs/sec throughput with 112ns avg processing
- **End-to-end pipeline**: 667ns tick-to-trade (22.5x better than targets)
- **All functional tests**: 100% pass rate (16/16 tests passing)

#### 🔄 Implemented But Needs Performance Validation
- **Market making strategy**: 70% complete
  - ✅ Sophisticated spread calculation with inventory adjustment
  - ✅ Position skewing and enhanced risk management
  - ✅ Multi-instrument support and P&L tracking
  - ❓ **Performance validation pending** (<2μs decision target)

- **Risk management framework**: 60% complete
  - ✅ Real-time position limits and circuit breakers
  - ✅ P&L calculations and compliance audit trails
  - ❓ **Integration validation pending** (<1μs calculation target)

- **Order management system**: 70% complete
  - ✅ Order lifecycle management and venue routing
  - ✅ Fill handling and state management
  - ❓ **End-to-end integration testing pending**

### Phase 3.5: Development Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS) 🔄
**Critical Issue Blocking Progress**

#### ✅ Working Infrastructure
- Build system: 100% test pass rate with comprehensive integration
- CI/CD integration: CTest framework with automated execution
- Component benchmarks: All executables built successfully

#### 🚨 Critical Blocking Issue
- **Benchmark execution framework broken**: Script path issues prevent performance validation
- **Missing baseline management**: Cannot track performance regressions
- **Performance validation non-functional**: Unable to verify <2μs strategy targets

**Immediate Priority**: Fix benchmark runner to complete Phase 3 validation

### Next Milestone: Complete Phase 3
Once benchmarks are fixed, validate:
- Strategy decision latency: <2μs target
- Risk calculation performance: <1μs target  
- Order management latency: <500ns target
- End-to-end integration: Full trading pipeline validation

## Verified Performance Achievements

| Component | Target | Achieved | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Timing overhead | <100ns | <100ns | ✅ EXCEEDS |
| Ring buffer latency | <50ns | 29.7ns | ✅ EXCEEDS |
| Object pool operations | <25ns | 8-18ns | ✅ EXCEEDS |
| Treasury yield calc | <100ns | 51-104ns | ✅ MEETS |
| Message parsing | <200ns | <200ns | ✅ MEETS |
| **Order book update** | **<500ns** | **407-455ns** | **✅ EXCEEDS** |
| **Best bid/offer** | **<100ns** | **13ns** | **✅ EXCEEDS** |
| **End-to-end pipeline** | **<15μs** | **667ns** | **✅ EXCEEDS** |

**Trading System Performance (PENDING VALIDATION):**

| Component | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Strategy decisions | <2μs | 🔧 NEEDS VALIDATION |
| Risk calculations | <1μs | 🔧 NEEDS VALIDATION |
| Order management | <500ns | 🔧 NEEDS VALIDATION |

## Build & Test

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.20+
- C++20 compiler with ARM64 optimizations
- Google Benchmark
- Google Test

### Building
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build
make -j
```

### Running Tests

#### Functional Tests (Working)
```bash
# Run all functional tests (16/16 currently passing)
ctest

# Run specific test categories
ctest -R strategy  # Strategy tests
ctest -R trading   # Trading tests
```

#### Performance Tests (Currently Broken)
